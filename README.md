[] Simple implementation of a merge sort algorithm.

[] A few basic rules:

    --> mergesort(None) returns None

    --> mergesort([]) returns empty list

    --> mlist may have duplicate entries, such as [7, 4, 3, 1, 7]. mergesort(list) should include the duplicates (in this case 7 and the return value should be [1,3,4,7,7]
